# About

_**Welcome to my GitHub!**_

I am a self-taught developer specializing in Rust. Currently working on constructing a topological computing system capable of efficiently aggregating resources from any number of devices into a single, cohesive experience. 

## Interests

* Artificial Intelligence
* Computation
* Decentalization and Distributed Systems
* Engineering
* Mathematics

## Projects

A majority of my coding is in support of some research that I am currently doing, so many of them are still early in development. That being said, several of my projects are becoming more refined and may be applicable for others.

* [`concision`](https://github.com/FL03/concision): a machine learning toolkit for rust
* [`eryon`](https://github.com/scattered-systems/eryon): a topological computing system blending music theory and computation 
* [`rshyper`](https://github.com/FL03/rshyper): A hash-based hypergraph implementation for rust
* [`rstm`](https://github.com/FL03/rstm): this crate implements concrete abstractions for experiementing with Turing machine models
* [`rstmt`](https://github.com/FL03/rstmt): a crate implementing various musical objects and primitives
